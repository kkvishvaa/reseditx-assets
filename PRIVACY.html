# Privacy Policy for ResEditX

**Last Updated: August 25, 2025**

## Overview

ResEditX ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Google Docs add-on.

## Information We Don't Collect

**ResEditX does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.**

Specifically, we do NOT:
- Store your documents or their content
- Keep copies of your resume text
- Collect personal information
- Track your usage patterns
- Share data with third parties
- Use cookies or tracking technologies

## How ResEditX Works

- **Local Processing**: All text processing happens within your Google Docs session
- **Temporary AI Processing**: When you use AI features, your text is sent to our AI service provider for processing and immediately discarded after generating results
- **No Permanent Storage**: We do not retain any text, documents, or personal information after processing

## Data Security

- All communications between ResEditX and AI services use encrypted HTTPS connections
- Your Google Docs content is never permanently stored outside of Google's servers
- We follow Google's security best practices for add-on development

## Third-Party Services

ResEditX uses Google's Gemini AI service for text processing. Your text is sent to Gemini for AI processing and is not stored by either ResEditX or Google Gemini beyond the processing session.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store your data, there's no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete. Your documents remain entirely under your control within Google Docs.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
